# Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf!

Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf! is a fanmade text-based adventure written in Javascript as a coding project. In this game you must try to evade Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf as he hunts you through the woods. Can you do it? It is fairly difficult but if you know the song you have a fighting chance.

 I'm still really new to all of this so I'm sure there's room for improvement. I used the package readline-sync to help build the game. If you download the game and enjoy it let me know! I'm open to all feedback!
